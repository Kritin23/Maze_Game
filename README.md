# Maze_Game
This project was created as a course project for Software Systems Lab course at IIT Bombay. \
The objective of this project is to create a 2D Maze Game using the pygame module in Python. The game consists of a single player-controlled character navigating through a maze with a restrictive 2D top view from the starting point to the end while avoiding obstacles and traps. The game has various difficulty levels, implements collision detection, and an intuitive user interface and integrates sound effects and visual effects.

## Running the Game
To run the game, you must have python3 and pygame installed. To start the game, navigate to the game directory and run `python3 game.py` in the terminal.
